This document reports an overview of the SWG we developed, mainly focusing on the design and manufacturing aspects of it.

### Stain Wave Gear

A Strain Wave Gearbox (SWG) is a unique mechanism designed to provide large gear ratios in a compact form using a flexible gear to achieve the gear reductions. 
-The cost of a small Harmonic Drive is around the range of 20,000 (INR) , which has quite a high power rating (400 W and above). A power rating of this scale is not needed for small scale projects and manipulators.
-The small scale SWGs available in the market currently are made of metal parts, which is a leading cause behind driving the costs up.The aim was to develop a Harmonic Drive that catered to this segment of technicians and engineers cost-effictively.

A SWG consists of **Circular Spline,Flex-spline and Wave generator** working in tandem to make up the mechansim.
A SWG uses a wave generator mounted by a flexspline to align teeth of circular splines using the principle of a wedge and achieve a larger gear ratio than conventional gear trains. 

The Flexspline fits in between the wave generator and the circular spline, hence being the key component in the mechansim that helps us achieve the reductions. 
The Flexspline as the name suggests undergoes flexing and thus a component that undergoes the highest scrutiny while designing a SWG. 

The SWG was designed and manufactured using fast prototyping methods (3D printing, laser cutting and water jet cutting) in order to facilitate the iterative approach of this project , this was essential as it helped us give real time feedback of discrepcencies in the design.
