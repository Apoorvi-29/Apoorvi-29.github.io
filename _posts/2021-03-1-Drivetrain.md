In this blog I narrate about the Transmission of an e -kart that me and teammates designed and fabricated for the IKR -  **Season 6 national go - karting event**.

Our latest design **Aryarath** houses a motor of 6KW rating with max rpm of 3000. In our previous designs we have used motors with a rating of 2.5 or 3 KW. It was a surreal experience to design the transmission system of such  high power rated motor.


### Requirements

- We were given the requirement of housing a motor that doesn't surpass the max 6 KW of rated power as driving unit of the vehicle.
- The drive to be installed had to be of rear wheel type , with the liberty to chose the type of transmission system (we used chain and sprocket system).
- The chain and sprocket system also had to be shielded via the means of a chain guard.
- The max speed the vehicle can attain is of 70 kmph.
- The average speed of the vehicle had to be around 45 kmph



### Design 

After the estimation of tractive force and hence calculating the the power required , we underwent many iterations to find a reduction ratio that met the torque as well as space requirements ( as the the wheelbase is fixed).

After obtaining the reduction ratio we get the forces acting on the shaft and thus material selection via ASME code is done to get the **diameter of the shaft**.
Once the Diameter of shaft is established , we proceed to select the bearings that support the shaft and act as the rolling element between the shaft and the mounts.

Compared to the previous years, the designs for components this time were such that weight reduction was given the utmost priority.
Keeping in mind the forces that the shaft experiences , a mount as such was designed that not only withstands the forces but also facilitated weight reduction in areas that didn't experience any deformation upon load application.

Keeping in mind the weight constraints, the wheel hub , that connects the shaft and the wheel also was designed such that it facilitated weight reduction in areas that didn't undergo deformation.

### Manufacturing

Once all the calculations and designs were done. We underwent the stage of procurement and fabrication.
I was in-part the member of welding team , whose job was to weld the profiled pipes to form the basic structure of the chassis i.e ladder frame and weld the mounts to this frame to form mounting points for the proccured components.

Once the basic structure of the frame was ready the rollhoop ,the bracers , the jack point and hitch point were welded next.

TIG welding was used to weld these pipes together.




Further brainstorming is being done to possibly install a differential to the drivetrain setup in the next E-kart for season 8.
