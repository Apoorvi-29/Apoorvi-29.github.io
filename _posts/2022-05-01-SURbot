Robotic systems are being developed to perform complex tasks that require precision and are difficult to intervene and observe with humans. These systems are gradually gaining traction and integrating into our daily lives. A two-wheeled robot is one such example.
In this project, the designing and assembling of a surveillance robot have been elaborated on. The primary aim of the robot is to serve as the first response mechanism for counter-insurgency and logistics operations.
The system was built utilizing an Arduino Uno Board with an Esp32-cam module and a differential drive system consisting of two BO motors and a motor driver (L298N bridge).
Jumper wires for connecting the differential system to the Arduino, Esp32-cam module, and the differential system.
This low-cost, low-consumption system can be used to monitor industries.

Two-wheeled robots have attracted a lot of attention from people all over the world because they are an excellent test case for applications of control design and distributed controls system during implementation. The main advantage of two-wheeled robots over other types of wheeled robots is their small structure and zero turning radius.
The wheels on wheeled robots propel them forward. They are less complex (in terms of driving mechanism) than other types of mobile robots, more regulated, and move much faster.
A two-wheeled bot is challenging to balance since the wheels must continue to move in the direction of the bot's fall to maintain balance. To counter this caster wheels have been added to the assembly
